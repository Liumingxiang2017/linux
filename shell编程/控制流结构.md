# 控制流结构

## if

条件判断控制结构：

单分支if语句
if 判断条件; then
  statement1
  statement2
  ...
fi

双分支的if语句：
if 判断条件; then
    statement1
    statement2
    ...
else
    statement3
    statement4
    ...
fi

多分支的if语句：
if 判断条件1; then
  statement1
  ...
elif 判断条件2; then
  statement2
  ...
elif 判断条件3; then
  statement3
  ...
else
  statement4
  ...
fi

```shell
if [];then
    command1
elif [];then
    command2
else
    command3
fi
```

## case

```shell
case value in
mode1)
    command1
    ;;
mode2)
    command2
    ;;
esac
```

## for

```shell
for variable in list
do
    command1
done

# list 可以是
    - 1 2 3..
    - orange red bule
    - "orange red blue"
    - `cat filename`
```

## until

```shell
until condition
do
    command1
done
# 至少执行一次

#举例
#!bin/bash
#监控分区
Part="/backup"
LOOK_OUT=`df|grep "$Part"|awk '{print $5}'|sed 's/%//g'`
echo $LOOK_OUT
until [ "$LOOK_OUT" -gt "90" ]
do
    echo "Filesystem /backup is nearly full"|mail root
    LOOK_OUT=`df|grep "$Part"|awk '{print $5}'|sed 's/%//g'`
    sleep 3600
done
```

## while

```shell
while [condition]
do
    command1
done

#举例
#!/bin/bash
while read LINE
do
    echo $LINE
done < name.txt
```

## break and continue

- break [n]
  - n表示几层循环
- continue

## 模式匹配符

- *表示任意字符
- ?表示任意单个字符
- [..]表示范围中任意字符
